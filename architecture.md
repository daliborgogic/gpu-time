# Architecture

## Contract

`parse(text, context)` accepts one string and a caller context of `{ reference, timeZone, limit }`, and returns `{ occurrences, rrules, diagnostics, truncated, backend, timings }`. `parseMany(texts, context)` batches several inputs, with multiple dispatches for large batches. `defineParser(options)` returns a reusable instance with an explicit `backend` and a `dispose()` method.

`reference` is an ISO instant, `timeZone` an IANA name, `limit` the maximum number of previewed occurrences. An unknown timezone rejects the call rather than falling back. Diagnostics report known problems, but model errors can still produce incorrect dates.

The caller context never enters the model. Timezone, daylight-saving transitions, the reference date, and expansion limits are resolved by ordinary TypeScript after inference. There is no public AST or token-label output; `packages/core/src/schedule.ts` exposes the intermediate schedule for in-repo evaluation only and is not a published entry point.

The package keeps its WebGPU device, pipelines, weights, and grow-only buffers resident between calls. `parse` and `parseMany` schedule through one internal default instance, so the function API does not imply per-call initialization.

## Source preparation

One CPU scan splits the input into tokens and emits a sparse feature row per token. Each row records character shape, casing, digit and punctuation class, length bucket, lexicon membership for the closed vocabulary of time words, and hashes of neighboring tokens. There are 324 embedding rows in the feature table.

The tokenizer uses regular expressions and a Serbian (Latin script) lexicon. The compiler and calendar resolver also run on the CPU.

## Learned context

The promoted model has 24,761 parameters, int6 weights, and f32 intermediates.

1. Sparse token features are summed into one learned vector per token.
2. Learned affine state updates scan the sequence in both directions, giving every token context within its input window. The browser kernel evaluates these scans in parallel blocks and carries exact block prefixes, so block boundaries do not reset context.
3. A classifier produces 40 output slots: 35 named semantic roles plus 5 reserved. The roles cover clock hours and minutes, meridiem, weekday, month, ordinal, year, quantity and unit, recurrence markers, range separators, bounds, exceptions, and filler. A `CLOCK_OFFSET` role distinguishes half and quarter clock arithmetic.
4. A boundary score per token cuts the sequence into independent expressions at threshold 1.75, so one input can yield several schedules.

Timezone has no role in the model. TypeScript computes timezone arithmetic after the model runs.

## Compilation and resolution

Predicted roles compile to a typed `Schedule`: date anchors, clock points, ranges, quantities, recurrence rules, and exclusions. The compiler assigns values to roles, resolves spoken numbers, and rejects role sequences that cannot form a valid schedule. It never consults the reference date.

The resolver then turns a schedule into instants. Calendar days and weeks preserve wall-clock time across DST; hours and minutes add elapsed time. Combined quantities apply in spoken order. Date-only ranges include the last named day and return an exclusive midnight endpoint; explicit clock endpoints return the stated instant. Recurrence produces a bounded preview plus RFC 5545 properties, with `truncated` signalling more occurrences beyond the preview. A weekly weekday rule with a monthly ordinal exception exports as the remaining ordinal weekdays; more complex exception combinations still preview correctly but return an `unsupported-export` diagnostic when one rule cannot represent them.

`packages/core/schema/schedule.schema.json` is generated from `src/types.ts` and validates the gold corpora.

## Model representation

The training exporter writes 6-bit symmetric per-tensor weights to `packages/core/src/model/weights.gen.ts`. Its SHA-256 hash must match `packages/training/active/export-report.json`. The active report records 18,571 logical packed bytes and 13,888 Brotli bytes for the weight module. The full package must pass the 50,000-byte Brotli release limit.

The WGSL kernel in `src/model/kernel.wgsl` is specialized at build time: `src/model/shader-source.ts` splices model constants into it, `wgslender` minifies the result, and the build inlines the minified shader and the trimmed weight table directly into the JavaScript bundle. The `.wgsl` file never ships. For f16 storage the build emits two shader variants, with and without native half support.

## Backend selection

`backend: "auto"` dispatches to WebGPU once a batch reaches 32 inputs or 512 tokens, and runs on CPU below that, where device dispatch and readback dominate. `"cpu"` forces the scalar path. `"webgpu"` forces the GPU path and **disables the internal CPU fallback**, so the caller owns both the no-WebGPU case and a mid-session device loss. Browser tests compare GPU output with the CPU reference.

## Training and supervision

Supervision is generated, not scraped. `packages/training/torch/generate.py` renders schedules, and `natural.py` adds natural-phrasing families including negative prose that contains no time expression at all. Labels come from the generator's own structure, never from the runtime parser — the model is never trained on its own output.

Each epoch draws fresh examples. The structural holdout and the unseen-sentence-frame evaluation are kept separate, because a split that only holds out rendered strings leaks the phrase family.

The model learns to distinguish time expressions from surrounding prose. `background.py` combines carrier phrases, and filtered Tatoeba sentences supply additional background. Every borrowed token receives the filler label `O`. The filter removes known time words and number patterns that resemble dates or times.

Every run snapshots its source files and their hashes into `runs/<run>/source/`, so an exported checkpoint can be traced to the exact generator and tokenizer that produced it. Export records that lineage in `active/export-report.json` and `active/provenance.json`; `pnpm --filter @gpu-time/training audit:model` re-verifies the chain. Export is also gated: a candidate ships only if it strictly improves the unseen-carrier score and passes per-family and bare-expression guards within a statistical tolerance, with both sides decoded from int6 and re-scored in the same process. See `MODEL_CARD.md` for the decision and the two metrics involved.

## Performance boundaries

WebGPU helps for warm, large, or batched inputs. Explicit WebGPU mode initializes the device during parser creation. Automatic mode waits until a batch needs it. Later calls reuse GPU resources. The runtime returns values to JavaScript, so it pays one readback synchronization per dispatch.

Automatic mode keeps small inputs on the CPU to reduce dispatch overhead. The recorded warm medians over 10,000 inputs are 82.7 ms on WebGPU and 702.5 ms on CPU. Tokenization, inference, and resolution are timed separately and reported in the `timings` field.
